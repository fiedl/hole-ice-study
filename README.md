# Hole Ice Study

This project aims to incorporate the effects of [hole ice](https://wiki.icecube.wisc.edu/index.php/Hole_ice) into the [clsim](http://github.com/claudiok/clsim) photon propagation simulation of the [icecube](http://icecube.wisc.edu) neutrino observatory.

Hole ice is the ice in the refrozen columns around the detector module strings. Because its properties may differ from the properties of the surrounding ice, photon propagation simulation needs to reflect the changed properties by allowing different photon scattering and absorption behaviour within the hole ice.

## Installation

### Install icecube-simulation framework

This software requires the icecube simulation framework. I've used version icecube-simulation V05-00-07.
